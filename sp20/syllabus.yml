    title: Survey on Hate Speech Detection using Natural Language Processing

      For our first paper in intelligence, we'll be covering how to detect hate speech
      using machine learning algorithms. This is a super interesting topic, because
      hate speech is often hard to define and depends a lot on the context surrounding
      it. This review paper will cover current state-of-the-art approaches for this
      problem.

    title: Pure Reasoning in 12-Month-Old Infants as Probabilistic Inference

      Many organisms can predict future events from the statistics of past experience,  but
      humans also excel at making predictions by pure reasoning-- integrating multiple  sources
      of information, guided by abstract knowledge, to form rational expectations
      about novel situations, never directly experienced. Here, we show that this
      reasoning is surprisingly rich, powerful, and coherent even in preverbal infants.

    title: Towards a Computational Model of Artificial Intuition and Decision Making

      The ability to perform a detailed decision-making approach based on  large quantities
      of parameters and data is at the core of the majority of sciences. Traditionally,
      all possible scenarios should be considered, and their outcomes assessed via
      a logical and systematic manner to obtain accurate and applicable methods for
      knowledge discovery. However, such  approach is typically associated with high
      computational complexity. In this article we discuss some requirements of artificial
      intuition and present a model of  artificial intuition that utilises semantic
      networks to improve a decision system.

      Piggybacking off our ethics discussion in this week's GBM, we'll be focusing
      on the ethical considerations surrounding use of artificial intelligence in
      therapeutic applications, specificially with respect to aiding current state
      of the art approaches to therapy. Much of the paper discusses surveys and statistics
      of physicians and their attitudes towards technology, and our discussion will
      extend this to address the ethical backdrop for  the topics mentioned.

      This week's paper will investigate a new approach for analyzing psychometric
      qualities from text. Psychometrics, such as emotions or personality traits,
      are often subconsciously conveyed through the manner in which people communicate.
      The authors of the paper propose a new method  for analyzing psychometric qualities
      of authors using a modification of other previously developed architectures
      for natural language processing and analysis.
