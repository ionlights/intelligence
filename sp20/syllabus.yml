    description: >-
        For our first paper in intelligence, we'll be covering how to detect
        hate speech using machine learning algorithms. This is a super interesting
        topic, because hate speech is often hard to define and depends a lot
        on the context surrounding it. This review paper will cover current
        state-of-the-art approaches for this problem.

    Many organisms can predict future events from the statistics of past experience, 
    but humans also excel at making predictions by pure reasoning-- integrating multiple 
    sources of information, guided by abstract knowledge, to form rational expectations
    about novel situations, never directly experienced. Here, we show that this reasoning
    is surprisingly rich, powerful, and coherent even in preverbal infants.

    description: >-
    The ability to perform a detailed decision-making approach based on 
    large quantities of parameters and data is at the core of the majority
    of sciences. Traditionally, all possible scenarios should be considered,
    and their outcomes assessed via a logical and systematic manner to obtain
    accurate and applicable methods for knowledge discovery. However, such 
    approach is typically associated with high computational complexity. In this article
    we discuss some requirements of artificial intuition and present a model of 
    artificial intuition that utilises semantic networks to improve a decision system.

    Piggybacking off our ethics discussion in this week's GBM, we'll be focusing on the ethical considerations
    surrounding use of artificial intelligence in therapeutic applications, specificially with respect to aiding
    current state of the art approaches to therapy. Much of the paper discusses surveys and statistics of physicians
    and their attitudes towards technology, and our discussion will extend this to address the ethical backdrop for 
    the topics mentioned.

      This week's paper will investigate a new approach for analyzing psychometric qualities from
      text. Psychometrics, such as emotions or personality traits, are often subconsciously conveyed
      through the manner in which people communicate. The authors of the paper propose a new method 
      for analyzing psychometric qualities of authors using a modification of other previously developed
      architectures for natural language processing and analysis.
